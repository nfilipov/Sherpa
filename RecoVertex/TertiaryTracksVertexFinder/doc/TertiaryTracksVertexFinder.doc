\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->


The TertiaryTracksVertexFinder (TTVF) is designed for reconstructing
secondary vertices in jets. It is documented in CMS Note 2006/027
where its implementation in the previous software framework ORCA is
called TertiaryVertexTrackFinder (TVTF). 

The basic idea is to find tracks from a tertiary charm hadron decay in
the b-c decay cascade, and associate them to the secondary vertex. The
procedure is as follows: First, the standard TrimmedKalmanVertexFinder
is run in order to reconstruct secondary vertex candidates. Then, a
filter is run on the vertices in which primary vertices, conversions,
nuclear interactions or K0 candidates are rejected. The b-flightline
is reconstructed from the primary and secondary vertex. Tracks close
to the b-flight line not associated to a vertex are searched and added
to the secondary vertex. Note that the position of the secondary
vertex is not recalculated after the additional tracks have been
added.
