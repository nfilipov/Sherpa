README FOR Creating CMS Detector Gemoetry Database (DGD)

Creation of CMS DGD involves three parts:
1. Contact to your local DBA to get agreement on account naming convention.
2. Create the DGD schema. 
3. Load data into the tables.

1. Contact to your local DBA to get agreement on account naming convention.
   1a. We follow CERN DBA naming convention through out the DGD creation. 
       So the schema name we define is CMS_YLG_DTCTR_GEOMETRY_OWNER. You 
       may define your schema name as CMS_XYZ_DTCTR_GEOMETRY_OWNER where 
       XYZ is the schema owner name key. Setup your schema owner password 
       with your DBA as well as the tablespace names.
   1b. modify scripts/build.properties by doing below:
         build.schema.owner.name.key=XYZ
         build.dbname=the-db-you-will-use
         build.schema.owner.passwd=schema-owner-passwd
         build.tablespacename.indx=CMS_XYZ_PRODUCTION_INDX
         build.tablespacename.data=CMS_XYZ_PRODUCTION_DATA
         build.tablespacename.blob=CMS_XYZ_PRODUCTION_BLOB
   1c. run build.xml script
       %cd scripts
       %ant -f build.xml account
   1d. hand the newly generated scripts (under scripts/setup-users-roles) to 
       your DBA and ask her/him to run it angist the database you will use. 
       This will create proper database account and roles for you to create DGD.


2. Create the DGD schema.
   2a. modify scripts/build.properties by doing below:
       build.dbusername=yuyiguo
       build.dbpasswd=yuyipwd 
       Note: This db account can be any account that allow you connect to the 
       db defined in " build.dbname". It cab alos be the same as the schema owner. 
       I perfer to use another account because it may have problem with newly 
       created account. This account only make you sqlplus to the db. You will not 
       create anything under this account.
   2b. run build.xml script:
       %cd scripts
       %ant -f build.xml setup-dgd-schema
   2c. Check the output file to make sure the schema was created w/o error.


3. Load data into the tables.
   3a. run CMS_DTCTR_GEOMETRY_OWNER/loading-scripts/asciidump.py on any linux 
       machine that has python 2.3 or above installed.Make sure you have a correct 
       configuration.xml that lists all the subdetectors' XML files you needed.
   3b. run COBRA_8_4_0/src/DDD/DDRegressionTest/test/physicalparts_table.cpp with
       a correct configuration.xml to generate data for tables NOMINALPLACEMENTS and 
       PHYSICALPARTSTREE. (This will change SOON.)
   3c. Run  CMS_DTCTR_GEOMETRY_OWNER/loading-scripts/load_all_tables.sh.

       If you really want to get rid off the DGD you created, you can drop entire DGD 
       by one command. This is only for a developer's convenience, please use it 
       with CAUSTION.
       %cd scripts
       %ant -f build.xml drop-dgd-schema
