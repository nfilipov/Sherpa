This file, ReadMe, is here just to be something in the doc 
directory of a CMSSW package. 

The 1st commitment of the SiPixelHistoricInfoClient package, 
a.k.a. 1st commitment of this package, compiles without any 
error in CMSSW_1_5_0 and CMSSW_1_6_0_pre4 as I have tested. 

To test it, go to the test directory and run setup.sh and
startHistoricInfoClient.
