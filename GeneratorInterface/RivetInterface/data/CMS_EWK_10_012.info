Description:
  A study of jet production in association with W and Z bosons for a jet transverse
  momentum threshold of 30 GeV of proton-proton collision data at 7 TeV cms energy 
  has been done. The study includes the measurement of the normalized inclusive rates 
  of jets produced, as well as the ratios of cross-sections and the first test of the 
  Berends-Giele scaling at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV.
